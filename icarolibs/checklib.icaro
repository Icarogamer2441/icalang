/* how to use "check": *\
/* this will not execute because it's not the command "something": *\
/* "something" takestr *\
/* "test" check yourfunction *\
/* this will work because the command it's the same: *\
/* "mycmd" takestr *\
/* "mycmd" check yourfunction *\
/* you need use this library with std library because it uses "dropstr" from std lib *\
